<div class="...">Roger had aged well into his golden years. His strong, gnarled hands supported him as he sat against a small wall in the shade of a Bur Oak at Klyde Warren Park. He smiled as children laughed in the park behind him. His hearing aids were adjusted to hear them better, and quiet the noisy traffic in front of him. A small blonde girl in a blue dress and a little boy in a Superman shirt chased each around the park, occasionally running in front of Roger. He whistled “Band of Gold” between his teeth and looked down Olive Street.
</div><div class="...">“Trolly’ll be here soon,” Roger said to Mick next to him. Mick stared ahead. He never really said much, but Roger liked his company. “Ya know, I used to work on a trolley.” Mick nodded. “In San Francisco.” Mick looked at Roger. “Ya know the trolley Rosie was brought to Dallas from the San Francisco Trolley Fair.” Mick nodded. Roger kept watching the cars. The children ran by again. “I wonder if Rosie is running today.” The girl stopped in front of Roger when he spoke, and the boy ran into her. The girl looked at Roger.
</div><div class="...">“Are you talking to me?” she asked. Roger looked at her. He smiled.
</div><div class="...">“Oh no, child. I was talking to my friend,” he indicated Mick next to him. The children looked where he pointed.
</div><div class="...">“There’s no one there,” the girl said.
</div><div class="...">“You’re it,” the boy said running away. The girl followed. Roger looked confused. He looked at Mick, who just shrugged. “My wife’s name was Rose,” he said. “I called her Rosie sometimes.” He looked at his naked left ring finger. “She died before we had kids.” Mick nodded. “We always wanted kids, but God never blessed us with any.” Roger looked at his feet. “We thought about adopting, but with the cancer, she took up all my time.” He kicked a small pebble. “Once I had time, I didn’t want to be a single parent.” He whistled “Band of Gold” between his teeth and looked down Olive Street.

He never really said much, but Roger liked his company. “Ya know, I used to work on a trolley.” Mick nodded. “In San Francisco.” Mick looked at Roger. “Ya know the trolley Rosie—” Suddenly, the blonde girl ran by, tripped, and fell off the curb. With speed unnatural for his age, Roger ran forward and grabbed the girl out of the street just as a large truck passed by. The truck mirror clipped Roger, spinning him around. Roger fell into the street.
</div><div class="...">Screeching tires. Crunching metal. Broken glass. Shouts. Cries.
</div><div class="...">Roger lay on the hot asphalt. He couldn’t feel if his hearing aids were still in. He couldn’t feel anything. But he could hear. There was the distinct ding-ding of a trolley bell. Roger smiled.
</div><div class="...">“It’s Rosie.”</div>
