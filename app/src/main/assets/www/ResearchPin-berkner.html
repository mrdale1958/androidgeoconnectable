                    <div class="hotspot_slide" id="1">I was a nationally known scientist, focusing on geophysics. I am proud to have been a contributor in the invention of the standard ionospheric measuring device.<br><br><br><br><br><br> </div>
                    <div class="hotspot_slide" id="2">Why would this device serve importance to the nation? Because it assisted the developing theory of short wave radio propagation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br> </div>
                    <div class="hotspot_slide" id="3">I also contributed to many other groundbreaking scientific discoveries and theories, such as how the Earth's atmosphere develops, the proposition of International Geophysical Year, and how the solar system's inner planets evolved.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br> </div>
                    <div class="hotspot_slide" id="4">I was also instrumental in founding the Graduate Research Center of the Southwest, which was the predecessor to UT Dallas. I was proudly the first president of UT Dallas.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br> </div>
                    <div class="hotspot_slide" id="5">Unfortunately, I died suddenly of a heart attack in 1967. Therefore, I ended my legacy at UT Dallas quite early.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br> </div>
                    <div class="hotspot_slide" id="6">Nonetheless, I was very pleased to be able to have come together with my colleagues to establish a facility that exists now as UT Dallas.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br> </div>
                    <div class="hotspot_slide" id="7">What if I had survived and lived longer? What would my impact on UT Dallas be like? Would we surpass UT Austinâ€™s research capabilities?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br> </div>
