                <div class="hotspot_box" id="basicDiv">
                    <div class="hotspot_slide" id="0">Hi! I’m Dr. Marjorie Zielke. I am leading a research called Individual Nystagmus Simulated Training Experience (INSITE) at the University of Texas at Dallas.</div>
                    <div class="hotspot_slide" id="1">In this research, my colleagues and I are aiming to innovatively assist police officers to better identify a strong clue in regard to people driving under the influence.</div>
                    <div class="hotspot_slide" id="2">What is this strong clue? Twitchy eyes. You may be wondering what causes twitchy eyes and how noticeable it really is.</div>
                    <div class="hotspot_slide" id="3">A condition called horizontal gaze nystagmus is indicative of twitchy eyes in a drunk driver. It is quick and involuntary, so sometimes it may be difficult to recognize, especially in a sobriety test setting.</div>
                    <div class="hotspot_slide" id="4">Our goal is to create a successful program that police officers can utilize to better recognize HGN. My team and I are partnered with Sam Houston State University and EyeT Plus, allowing us to create Brian.</div>
                    <div class="hotspot_slide" id="5">Who is Brian? He’s the virtual impaired driver and the key component in helping train police officers. He works as a simulation that is programmed to display as a lifelike appearance.</div>
                    <div class="hotspot_slide" id="6">Police officers can move their fingers towards the motion sensors, and Brian’s eyes will follow. A lot of programming, algorithmic maps, and analytics were emitted into this program.</div>
                    <div class="hotspot_slide" id="7">Though we aspire to help numerous police training programs, we do not have enough funds to do so. As of right now, we predict to help train 500 officers.</div>
                    <div class="hotspot_slide" id="8">But what if my research was awarded more funds? What if INSITE could be nationally recognized? How would this change my reputation as a UTD researcher?</div>
                    <div class="hotspot_slide" id="9">What if I embedded other conditions into the program? Such as the use of marijuana and other drugs. Would this hurt or benefit UTD students?</div>
                </div>
