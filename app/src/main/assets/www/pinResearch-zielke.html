What is this strong clue? Twitchy eyes. You may be wondering what causes twitchy eyes and how noticeable it really is. A condition called horizontal gaze nystagmus is indicative of twitchy eyes in a drunk driver. It is quick and involuntary, so sometimes it may be difficult to recognize, especially in a sobriety test setting. Our goal is to create a successful program that police officers can utilize to better recognize HGN. My team is partnered with Sam Houston State University and EyeT Plus, allowing us to create Brian. Who is Brian? He’s the virtual impaired driver and the key component in helping train police officers. He works as a simulation that is programmed to display as a lifelike appearance. Though we aspire to help numerous police training programs, we do not have the funds.";
