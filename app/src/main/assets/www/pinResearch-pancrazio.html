I received my PhD in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Virginia, with PhD training focused on the ion channel electrophysiology using the patch clamp technique. I received a National Research Service Award, and did my postdoctoral training in pharmacology. My current researches carry a theme on the development and demonstration of novel neural interface technology. My lab aims to create new devices capable of neural stimulation and recording. We conduct studies to model the tissue-electrode interface and real time imaging of neuronal activity. My position in the Office of Research allows me to be a part of overseeing the following: Research funding & facilities, technology commercialization & licensing, compliance & safety, and the Institutional Review Board.";
