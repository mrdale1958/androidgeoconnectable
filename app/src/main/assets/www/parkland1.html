<h2 style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"><center>Dallas first opened a city hospital on Lamar street in 1874, moving to Maple Avenue in the 1890s. In 1913, a new state of the art facility was erected, reflecting a nationwide movement toward modern medical care. The new building was the source of development for the neighborhood as a medical center and also the first home to Southwestern Medical College (now the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School). In 1954, Parkland Hospital relocated to a new facility at 5201 Harry Hines Blvd, where it set standards in healthcare and in medical advances. On November 22, 1963, John F. Kennedy was taken to that facility following his assassination. Today, Parkland Hospital continues to be a leader in providing medical care to the needy.</center></h2>

<h2 style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"><center>Some important people in the development of the parkland hospital was City of Dallas Health Officer Dr. John L. Carter. In 1887 he demanded a hospital to be built stating: "the sick people of this city have a right to demand more accommodations. Humanity demands it. I shall never tire until something is done in the interest of the poor, sick people in my care." Carter then concluded that, "what we ask for is a necessity, not a luxury."Until 1922, Parkiand was used exclusively for indigent care.</center></h2>

<h2 style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"><center>To get the hospital started, the City Council ordered that a group of ladies, Mrs. H.S. Ervay, Miss Duggy Ewell, Mrs. A. A. Johnston, and three other "be requested to act as a committee to solicit subscriptions to erect a city hospital building."Within two months, the ladies received a resolution of thanks for securing donations. On February. 11, Drs. Hughes, Carrington, Johnston and Mayor Ben Long were named as a committee to take charge of the funds and to contract for the construction of a hospital building. Dr. Matthias A. Cornelius was elected Dallas' first Health Officer.</center></h2>

<h2 style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"><center>Until 1922, Parkland was used exclusively for the indigent. However, during the Depression, more and more people found it necessary to call on the cityâ€”county hospital system for care and treatment. Some of these patients were admitted. As time went by the hospital grew. The Old Parkland wasn't enough and a series of new hospitals have grown from it. Today the Old Parkland Hospital has been renovated to be a new headquarters for Crow Holdings. So as you can see the hospital has a long history in Dallas.</center></h2>
