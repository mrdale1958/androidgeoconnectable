Erik Jonsson, Eugene McDermott, and Lloyd Berkner after they founded Texas Instruments. They wanted a research facility. After honing the focus, the founders created the Graduate Research Center of the Southwest (GRCSW) in 1961, funded partially by government funds and TI shares. <br><br><br><br><br></div>
                  <div class="hotspot_slide" id="1">Drs. Jonsson and Berkner were the key figures in the founding of the GRCSW, which gathered a great deal of interest from academics and military leaders, unsurprisingly.<br><br><br><br><br> </div>
                  <div class="hotspot_slide" id="2">After making discoveries for over eight years in space and geosciences, the GRCSW was integrated into the UT system in 1969 as the University of Texas at Dallas.br><br><br><br><br><br> </div>
