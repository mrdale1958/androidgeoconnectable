I was a nationally known scientist, focusing on geophysics. I am proud to have been a contributor in the invention of the standard ionospheric measuring device. I also contributed to many other groundbreaking scientific discoveries and theories, such as how the Earth's atmosphere develops, the proposition of International Geophysical Year, and how the solar system's inner planets evolved. I was also instrumental in founding the Graduate Research Center of the Southwest, which was the predecessor to UT Dallas. I was proudly the first president of UT Dallas. Unfortunately, I died suddenly of a heart attack in 1967. Therefore, I ended my legacy at UT Dallas quite early. Unfortunately, I died suddenly of a heart attack in 1967.
